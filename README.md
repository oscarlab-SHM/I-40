# I-40 Bridge 

The I-40 bridge is constructed on Rio Grande river in Alburquerque, New Mexico. 
Previous studies on this bridge has reported damage identification and effect of damage on dynamic properties of bridge. 
This research focuses on analysing the poor condition of the I-40 Bridge due to crack generation in one of its plate girders.
The detected crack was recorded in 2019 but continuous crack propagation led to its fracture on May 11, 2021 resulting in a complete shutdown of the bridge.
Notably, disruptions in the structural anatomy of a bridge produces degradation patterns in the form of mass and stiffness losses, pier‚Äìtear, deck cracks, and abutment settlements  Recently, on 12ùë°‚Ñé September, 2024 the Carola Bridge in Dresden, Germany partially collapsed in Elbe river due to the corrosion caused by chlorides. Earlier, the bridge over Patapsco River in Baltimore, USA came crashing down after a cargo ship collided against it causing severe damage to span and life of 6 workers on March 26th, 2024.
On August 14th, 2018, The Polcevera viaduct in Genoa, Italy (also known as Morandi Bridge) collapse due to a number of issues, including poor maintenance and cable corrosion on the bridge, causing the death of 43 people. Bridges that show significant levels of deterioration in their major components are categorized as structurally deficient and are more likely to damage.
Publicly constructed facilities are generally expected to achieve an uninterrupted service life of 75 years with only routine maintenance and no structural deficiencies. Structurally deficient bridges, however, exhibit significant deterioration that requires immediate rehabilitation beyond routine maintenance, interrupting normal service. According to the U.S. National Bridge Inventory (NBI), out of a total of 5,97,443 bridges, 12.35% (73,800) are classified as structurally deficient. In ASCE‚Äôs 2021 Report Card, American bridges graded as C, down from a C+ in 2017. UK and Canada, uses Bridge condition index (BCI) which rates bridges on a scale from 0 to 100. In Australia, National bridge maintenance management system (NBMMS) is used which assesses bridges based on a condition rating scale from 1 (very good) to 5 (very poor).

Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques plays a vital role in the built infrastructure for accurate and early damage detection to save on repair and maintenance costs. Mainly damage detection (DD) studies focus on linear systems, but practical systems such as built infrastructures are highly nonlinear (owing to geometric orientations, material considerations, and unknown force impacts leading to contact nonlinearities). A common approach for damage detection and anomaly identification for bridge infrastructure is obtaining time-history responses over a monitoring period and providing it as an input to a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) module. However, EP methodologies fundamentally cater to weakly nonlinear systems which makes them a non‚Äìoptimal choice for practical systems. For built infrastructure ‚Äì where nonlinearities arise from coupled parameters of geometric and material properties ‚Äì methods dedicated towards local parameter extraction are highly sought after. In such cases, the use of nonlinear DD strategies become increasingly paramount. One such algorithm that has been previously employed in similar exploration is Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). The current research explores the post-rehabilitation strength and dynamic characteristics for I-40 Bridge and a comparative study for modal responses for damage and undamaged case is carried out. The work is further extended to observe the changes in structural responses (deflection and  stress) of bridge under varied dynamical loading. While the observant characteristics of the bridge does not fall under the inherent dynamic properties (viz. mode shape, natural frequencies, and damping ratios) show significant changes.
