The I-40 bridge is constructed on Rio Grande river in Alburquerque, New Mexico. 
Previous studies on this bridge has reported damage identification and effect of damage on dynamic properties of bridge. 
This research focuses on analysing the poor condition of the I-40 Bridge due to crack generation in one of its plate girders.
The detected crack was recorded in 2019 but continuous crack propagation led to its fracture on May 11, 2021 resulting in a complete shutdown of the bridge.
